This repository demonstrates a common error in VHDL: integer overflow in a counter. The provided code implements a simple counter that increments on each rising clock edge. However, it lacks proper handling of the case when the counter reaches its maximum value.  The solution shows how to correctly handle overflow by using a modulo operation or wrapping the counter around to 0 after reaching the maximum value.  This example highlights the importance of carefully considering potential overflow conditions when working with integer types in VHDL.
